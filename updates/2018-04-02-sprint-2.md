# 10x Open Source Translation Service: Sprint #2

The second update of our 10x Phase I Investigation. This phase is approximately
2 weeks, ending about April 4th, 2018. We are investigating how
a government-wide translation service might aid in providing content in more
languages using existing open source software.


## Last week

Last week we loaded some example content from [USA.gov's
API](https://platform-api.usa.gov/) into
[Pootle](https://translate.app.cloud.gov/projects/usa-gov-example/) to
demonstrate how content can be imported, translated, and exported. We documented
[roughly how this import/export
works](https://github.com/18F/10x-translation-service/blob/master/workflow.md#upload-content-for-translation).

We investigated and documented the [Drupal use-case](use-cases/drupal.md) for
translations which we expect to be a common use-case in government.

We started scheduling interviews with some members of the Translation Community
of Practice to get input on their translation workflows and how Pootle could be
of assistance.


## This week

We've got a few more interviews scheduled with members of the Multilingual
Community of Practice for this week.

We'll be wrapping up and producing the Investigation report later in the week.
