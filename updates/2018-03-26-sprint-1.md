# 10x Open Source Translation Service: Sprint #1

The first update of our 10x Phase I. This phase is approximately 2 weeks, ending
about March 30th, 2018. We are investigating how a government-wide translation
service might aid in providing content in more languages using existing open
source software.


## Last week

We set up an [instance of Pootle](https://translate.app.cloud.gov/projects/) on
cloud.gov. By providing working software using off-the-shelf open source tools,
we can demonstrate how the federal government can better manage content for
language translation.


## This week

This week we are working to get some example content into Pootle to demonstrate
how content can be imported, exported, and translated. We plan on using
USA.gov as an example.

We'll also reach out to to members of the Translation Community of Practice to
get feedback on their translation workflows and how Pootle could be of
assistance.
