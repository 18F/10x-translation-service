# Research plan

As part of understanding how government translation projects operate and
identify needs and pain points, we'll interview several projects according to
this plan.


## Goals

- Understand the workflow used for existing translation projects.
- Identify needs and pain points in existing translation projects.
- Investigate opportunities for a Translation Service to address these needs
  and pain points.


## Questions for translation projects

1. Tell us about your project and your role.
1. How many languages do you publish in your project?
1. Do you translate all of your website content into all the languages? If
   not, how do you go about deciding what should be translated?
1. Do you translate non-content website copy, such as menus, footers,
   and other micro-copy?
1. How does your project manage new content for translation?
1. Do you use any software or service to aid in translations or managing the
   translation workflow?
1. What format(s) do you use to manage translations?
1. What kinds of quality control do you have in place to verify translations?
1. Does your project perform usability sessions, and if so, do you also test
   translated content?


## Usability scenarios

### Translators

> You are a translator for USA.gov. The administrator has told you that there is
> some English content ready for translation available in the new Tranlsation
> Workflow System. You'll use this new Translation Workflow System to walk you
> through each piece of content that needs to be translated.
